An example of Coq plugin that outputs the content of a global
definition in a file. 

- This plugin defines a new vernacular command [Output foo as "bar"]
  which normalizes [foo], and outputs it in the file named "bar". The
  normalization is done using [vm_compute], and [foo] must be a global
  definition. (That is, [Output (1+1) as "bar"] would not work.)

- The final pretty-printing is done using the current state of the
  pretty-printing machine: opening the right scopes, and defining
  notations may make a huge difference in terms of what the output
  looks like.
