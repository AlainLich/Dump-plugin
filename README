An example of Coq plugin that defines some custom timing tactics. 

This plugin has beem compiled succesfully with Coq 8.3-pl4

INSTALL
=================

coq_makefile -f arguments.txt -o Makefile
make 
make install

USAGE
=================

This plugin defines a few new tactics:
- [run_timer n] (with n being an integer) starts the timer [n]
- [stop_timer n] (with n being an integer) stops the timer [n]
- [reset_timer n] (with n being an integer) resete the timer [n]
- [print_current_time] prints the current time of the day (as a 
  floating poing number)

This plugin defines two new vernacular commands:
- [Print Timing Profile] which iterates through all the defined
  timers, and print the time they have been running
- [Clear Timing Profile] clears the global state

A few notes:
- this plugin uses a global state that is _not_ kept in sync when
moving bottom up in a PG buffer
- if a timer is started inside a tactic, which later fails, then the
timer is not implicitely stopped
- a timer that is already stopped may be stopped again...
